 Assignment 1 - AVISPA
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 A few additions that were made from my side are :
 	
 	1. The addition of a random nonce to the message sent by the user
 		to the server at state 1 ensures message variability to segregate between
 		multiple requests.
 	
 	2.	A final ACK message is sent by the server once confirmation of the session
 		is done and the session keys are established.
 		
 	3.	An intruder is introduced in order to ensure the proper working of the 
 		protocol.
 		
 	4.	OFMC and ATSE backends were both tested upon and both returned "SAFE" states
 		under the goals considered. Both depth first and depth first search algorithms
 		were run under the ATSE mode to observe promising results.
 		
 	5. Code section is well documented with brief explanations of steps
 		
 		
 		 		
 Challenges faced :
 
 	1.	Since we do not have the capability of computing modulus, some of the key
 		points of the protocol cannot be simulated using AVISPA tool.
 		
 	2. Deciding the goals that must be met for the protocol to be secure.
 	
 
 
 Learning outcomes :
 
 	1.	I have a better understanding of how to use the AVISPA tool and programming in 
 		HLPSL language.
 		
 	2.	A lot of the complicated request-response mechanisms involved in a mutual 
 		authentication scheme were made evident by this exercise.
